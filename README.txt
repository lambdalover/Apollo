Apollo v0.1

Apollo is a functional reactive programming (FRP) framework written in Scala.
A purely functional approach is taken. It is largely based on the work of
Nilsson, Courtney and Peterson in Haskell:

However, the approach referenced above is based on the use of arrow combinators
and leverages Haskell's arrow syntax (proc etc.). Apollo instead mimics the
feel of arrows in a purely monadic context.

In the end I'm not really sure this mimicry of arrows is really successful.
Still, there are some interesting examples of the kinds of things you can
express in there.

This is no longer under active development but I'm releasing this now in the vague hope that someone might find it useful. You never know. ;-)
